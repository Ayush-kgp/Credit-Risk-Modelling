# Credit-Risk-Modelling

The objective of the project was to develop a machine learning-based credit risk assessment model to evaluate a customer's creditworthiness and determine the likelihood of loan repayment. The project aimed to address the challenge of automating loan approvals by reducing manual efforts, improving prediction accuracy, and minimizing financial risks for banks.

-> Algorithms: Implemented Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree for classification.

-> Feature Selection: Conducted Chi-square tests, ANOVA, and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to identify the most significant predictors, ensuring a robust and interpretable model.

-> Model Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

-> Deployment: Developed a Flask-based web application to provide real-time predictions for users.

-> Tools & Libraries: Python, Scikit-Learn, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

This was an independent project, meaning all aspects, from data preprocessing and model building to deployment, were handled individually.

Outcomes: 

Successfully developed a highly accurate predictive model, improving loan approval decisions.

Applied advanced feature selection techniques, which improved model interpretability and reduced overfitting.

Showed that using machine learning to financial risk assessment is feasible and can reduce the need for manual screening.
